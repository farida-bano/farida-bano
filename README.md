### ✨ Features  
- **Feature 1**:I created a project in four parts: In the first part, I implemented a user login and registration system with username, password, a search bar, and social media links. The second part involves a transaction feature where users can enter the amount, card number, transaction type, and submit the transaction. In the third part, I added transaction history functionality, allowing users to view, clear, and download their transaction history, with the ability to filter transactions from the last two weeks. Finally, I included a footer at the bottom of the page for a complete layout..  
- **Feature 2**: Add another brief description here.
